```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#This is the setup chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#The two packages being used in this code are tidyverse and readr, both are available on CRAN and can be installed if necessary with the following lines of code:

#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("readr")

library(readr)
```

#Data Tidying

2) Tidying the RSD Data
```{r Tidying RSD Data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#This code chunk tidies the ICPMS RSD data
#this is done separately from the overall data tidying to ensure the RSD values 
#are properly matched to the correct sample reading (CPS)

RSD_Data<-ICPMS_Imported %>%
  #first the RSD columns are selected and renamed with the appropriate metal isotope
  select(Cr52 ='CPS RSD', 
         Cr53 ='CPS RSD_1', 
         As75 ='CPS RSD_2', 
         Cd111 ='CPS RSD_3', 
         Cd114 ='CPS RSD_4', 
         Pb208='CPS RSD_5',
         Ge72 ='CPS_7',
         'Sample Key')%>% 
  #The sample key is also selected for later use in verifying 
  #that the RSD data is properly matching the CPS Data
  
  #then the newly renamed RSD columns are gathered together and 
  #a column is created to indicate which metal corresponds to which RSD
  gather(Cr52, Cr53, As75, Cd111, Cd114, Pb208, Ge72, key = "Metal", value = "RSD")%>%
  
  #Then the RSD values are mutated to insure that they are in a numeric format,
  #this helps prevent type related errors
  mutate(RSD=as.numeric(RSD))

#Previewing the Tidy RSD Data
RSD_Data
```

3) Tidying the CPS Data
```{r CPS ICPMS Tidying}
#Tidying the CPS Data for ICPMS and combining back in the RSD data
ICPMS_Tidy <- ICPMS_Imported %>% 
  
  #Starting with renaming all of the CPS data with the appropriate metal
  rename(Cr52 = CPS,
         Cr53 = CPS_1,
         As75 = CPS_2,
         Cd111 = CPS_3,
         Cd114 = CPS_4,
         Pb208 = CPS_5,
         Ge72 = CPS_7)%>% 
  #Next gathering the CPS data and creating a column that indicates the coressponding metal 
  gather(Cr52, Cr53, As75, Cd111, Cd114, Pb208, Ge72, key= "Metal", value="CPS")%>% 
  
  #Selecting the relevant columns 
  #this can be adjusted to fit the data analysis being performed
  select('Sample Key', Metal, CPS)%>% 
  
  #mutating in the RSD data
  mutate(RSD = RSD_Data$RSD)


#Confirming that the RSD data properly matches the CPS data
#Should output TRUE if the data is properly matching 
all(RSD_Data$'Sample Key'==ICPMS_Tidy$'Sample Key', RSD_Data$Metal==ICPMS_Tidy$Metal)

#Previewing the ICPMS Data
ICPMS_Tidy
```

4) Merging in the Sample Key
```{r merging sample key}
#Merging together the ICPMS Data and the Sample Key
ICPMS_Merged <- merge(ICPMS_Tidy, Sample_Key_Imported)

#Previewing the merged data
ICPMS_Merged
```
