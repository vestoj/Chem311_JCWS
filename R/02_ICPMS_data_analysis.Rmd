```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
#Note! Before running this file you must run file 1 (01_ICPMS_data_tidying.Rmd)
ICPMS
```

1) Start by defining useful lists; such as what sites, metals, and sample IDs were analyzed.

```{r}
sites_analyzed <-ICPMS %>% 
  select(site)%>%
  unique()%>%
  filter(site!= "QC", site!="MB", site!="") #excluding method blank and quality control from the list of sites

metals_analyzed <-unique(ICPMS$metal)
sample_IDs <-unique(ICPMS$sample.key)

#Preview the lists to check for potential issues:
sites_analyzed #note: this is appearing as a data column, however functionally it should work as a list (if you run is.list the output is TRUE)
metals_analyzed
sample_IDs
```
```
